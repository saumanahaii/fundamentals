    //10print is a famous program originally written in Basic.  It is incredibly simple, but the effect is fantastic.

    //without it.  Go ahead and try it!  double slashes stack closer together in non-monospace fonts.

        //normally I'd do this all in one line, but that bit above is long enough to be broken out.
